<h1>Abuse</h1>

<p>
Purple is a small personal site. It has only a handful of users, all
of whom know each other personally. We are quite confident no spam is
leaving our site.

<p>
That said, purple is also a common English word, and spammers
sometimes use purple return addresses (without our permission).

<!--
<p>
Here's a log of unauthorized uses of purple addresses of which we are
aware:

<table border="1" cellpadding="5">

  <tr>
    <td>3 June 2003</td>
    <td>"Subject: d Detecttive Sofwtware" and similar</td>
    <td>Sent from an Outlook Express user with a forged purple return
	address. The subject line changes slightly each time, although
	human readers still understand.</td>
  </tr>
