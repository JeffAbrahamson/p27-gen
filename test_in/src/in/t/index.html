<h1>Purple T-shirts</h1>

<p> Be a part of purple in your own way.  Wear purple.com wherever you
go.  It's not free but it is pointless!  (If you want free <i>and</i>
pointless, check out the <a href="../affinity/index.html">Purple
Affinity</a> program.)  </p>

<p>For the moment, we only have one t-shirt to propose: on the back,
centered, "I support diversity", on the front, "purple.com/blue":

<p><img alt="diversity t-shirt" src="diversity.png"></p>

For sale <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/i_support_diversity_purple_com_blue_shirts-235234511002763817">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yes, this page is lame, I'll fix it up soon-ish. I'll add some
      extra t-shirts, too.</li>
  <li>If you're good at graphic design and want to help, I gratefully accept
      help, both pull requests on the <a
      href="https://github.com/JeffAbrahamson/purple">site</a> and
      design help on t-shirts and other merchandise.</li>
  <li>In the event that any of these t-shirts actually sell, the point
      is to subsidise running the site.  And to have fun.</li>
  <li>I'm open to ideas on other vendors and vendors who are
      non-U.S. friendly. Ideally, add to this <a
      href="https://github.com/JeffAbrahamson/purple/issues/2">issue</a>
      on github.</li>
  <li>I'm open to suggestions on T-shirt designs, too: same <a href="https://github.com/JeffAbrahamson/purple/issues/2">issue</a>.</li>
</ul>
